I have developed a dynamic and interactive grocery list project using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript. The project features an animated background that adds a visually appealing touch. 
It includes an input field and an add button, allowing users to easily add new items to the list. 
Each item is displayed in a specific field, accompanied by an edit button and a delete button 
for easy management. Additionally, I have implemented a feature where users can mark items 
as done once they are completed. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end web 
development and my ability to create user-friendly and interactive interfaces.
